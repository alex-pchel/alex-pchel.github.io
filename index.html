    <h1>Alexey Pchelnikov</h1>
    <p>I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in finance, built over nearly two decades in banking and structured finance roles. After earning my Master of Data Science from the University of Edinburgh in 2024, I am now focused on transitioning into a data science career where I can combine my deep industry expertise with analytical and technical skills.</p>

        <p>My goal is to apply machine learning, data analysis, and financial modeling to solve real-world problemsâ€”particularly those at the intersection of finance and technology. I invite you to explore my portfolio projects, learn more about my background, and connect if you're interested in collaboration or have opportunities where my hybrid experience could add value.</p>

    <h2>Portfolio Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3><a href="project_isb.html">Interactive Stock Dashboard</a></h3>
      <p>A web-based dashboard that provides a company overview, historical share price chart with customizable technical indicators, and a machine learning-based prediction of next-day price movement (up/down). Stock data is fetched via AlphaVantage API, while company descriptions are generated using external LLM via OpenRouter API. The price prediction is powered by a classic ML model (SVM or Logistic Regression) trained on historical data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3><a href="#">Project Two</a></h3>
      <p>Short summary of the second projectâ€”maybe a machine learning model or financial analysis tool.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3><a href="#">Project Three</a></h3>
      <p>Description of the third project. Highlight what makes it interesting or useful.</p>
